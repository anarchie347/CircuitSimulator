# CircuitSimulator

A public version of circuit simulator project

This repo does not include any images required for this project due to copyright reasons. The program will still work without the images

The images for the diagram mode will be added, the images for the drawing mode must be supplied by the user

This uses re-implemented data structures from [my data structures library](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Anarchie.DataStructsLib/1.0.0), as this was part of the project
